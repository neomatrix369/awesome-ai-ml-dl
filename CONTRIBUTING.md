## Pull Requests 

There are two required criteria for a pull request:

1. If an entry has a similar scope as other entries in the same category, the description must state the unique features that distinguishes it from the other entries.

2. If an entry does not meet conditions *(a)* to *(d)* there has to be an explanation either in the description or the pull request why it should be added to the list.

Self-promotion is not encouraged, but your suggestion will of course be approved if the criteria match. Self-promotion can be done within reasons if the content shared is useful to the audience and helps the current and future community, or around those lines. These kinds of submissions will be looked into case-by-case basis.

Furthermore, please ensure your pull request follows the following guidelines:

* Please search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Please make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
* Use the following format for libraries: \[RESOURCE\]\(LINK\) - DESCRIPTION.
* Entries should be sorted in ascending alphabetical order, i.e. a to z.
* New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
* Keep descriptions short, simple and unbiased.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.

Thank you for your suggestions!
