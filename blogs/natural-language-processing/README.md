> Traditional NLP techniques and methods (pre-transformer era and classical approaches)

## About This Category

This category covers traditional Natural Language Processing techniques including sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, text classification, topic modeling, and other classical NLP methods. While transformers have revolutionized NLP, understanding these foundational techniques remains valuable for many applications.

For modern transformer-based and LLM approaches, see the [Large Language Models](../large-language-models/) category.

## Topics Covered

- Text Classification
- Sentiment Analysis
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Topic Modeling (LDA, LSA)
- Text Preprocessing & Tokenization
- Part-of-Speech Tagging
- Dependency Parsing
- Information Extraction
- Text Summarization (extractive)
- Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText)
