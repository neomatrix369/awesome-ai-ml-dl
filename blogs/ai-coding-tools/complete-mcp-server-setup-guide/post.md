# The Complete MCP Server Setup Guide: Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and Cursor

*Stop wasting time with broken configs. Here's the setup that actually works.*

## Why This Guide Exists

You've probably stumbled across 5 different blog posts about MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, tried 3 different configs, and ended up with nothing working. The documentation is scattered, package names are wrong in popular guides, and nobody tells you which config file goes where.

This guide fixes that. One comprehensive walkthrough for all three tools.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Replace Usernames and Paths

**Before you start**: Replace all placeholders with your actual system information:
- **`YOUR_USERNAME`** → Your actual username (run `whoami`)
- **`/path/to/allowed/directory`** → Actual directory paths

**Example:**
```json
// ❌ WRONG
"/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/claude-mcp-configs/shared-memory.json"

// ✅ CORRECT
"/Users/john/claude-mcp-configs/shared-memory.json"
```

## Quick Reference: Which Tool When?

Before we dive into setup, understand what you're installing:

| Tool | Best For | Interface | Config Location |
|------|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Claude Desktop** | GUI workflows, exploring projects | Desktop app | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (Mac) |
| **Claude Code** | Terminal workflows, CI/CD, scripting | CLI | `~/.claude.json` |
| **Cursor IDE** | Full IDE experience, VS Code users | Desktop IDE | `.cursor/mcp.json` (project) or global settings |

**Architecture**

To illustrate how shared-memory works between the different tools that can access MCP servers:

```
┌─────────────────┐
│ Claude Desktop  │──┐
└─────────────────┘  │
                     │    ┌──────────────────┐
┌─────────────────┐  ├───▶│ Memory MCP Server│
│  Claude Code    │──┤    │  (shared file)   │
└─────────────────┘  │    └──────────────────┘
                     │
┌─────────────────┐  │
│   Cursor IDE    │──┘
└─────────────────┘
```

**Key Insight**: You can run all three and share the same MCP servers!

## 🎯 Choose Your Setup Path

**Before diving into the detailed guides, decide which approach fits your needs:**

### 🚀 RECOMMENDED: Individual MCP Servers
**Best for**: Understanding what you're setting up, full control, custom configurations
- **Granular control**: Choose exactly which servers you need (memory, filesystem, sequential-thinking)
- **Custom configurations**: Shared memory paths, specific file permissions, cross-tool sharing
- **Learning experience**: Understand how each MCP server works individually
- **Setup time**: 15-30 minutes

### 🔧 ALTERNATIVE: Simple Setup (mcp-cursor)
**Best for**: Quick setup, beginners who want to get started fast, minimal configuration
- **One package**: `mcp-cursor` includes memory, filesystem, and reasoning capabilities
- **Minimal configuration**: Works out of the box with basic setup
- **Cross-tool compatibility**: Works seamlessly across Claude Desktop, Claude Code, and Cursor
- **Setup time**: 5-10 minutes

**💡 Pro tip**: Start with individual servers to understand the system, then consider mcp-cursor for convenience.

## Part 1: Foundation Setup

### Prerequisites

<details>
<summary><strong>Platform-Specific Installation Instructions</strong></summary>

**All Operating Systems:**
```bash
# Verify Node.js (v16+ required)
node --version

# Verify npm
npm --version

# Install Claude Code CLI (if needed)
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

**macOS-specific:**
```bash
# Install Node.js via Homebrew (recommended)
brew install node
```

**Windows-specific:**
- Download Node.js installer from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
- Or use Chocolatey: `choco install nodejs`
- Or use winget: `winget install OpenJS.NodeJS`

**Linux-specific:**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs npm

# Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install nodejs npm

# Arch
sudo pacman -S nodejs npm
```

</details>

### Critical Package Name Correction

**STOP**: Many guides (including QED42's popular post) use wrong package names.

❌ **WRONG**: `@mcp-plugins/memory`  
✅ **CORRECT**: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory`

❌ **WRONG**: `@mcp-plugins/file-system`  
✅ **CORRECT**: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem`

This error alone causes 80% of failed installations.

## Part 2: Complete Setup by Product

**Choose your tool below for detailed setup instructions:**

Each guide is comprehensive and includes installation, configuration, verification, and troubleshooting specific to that tool.

---

### 2.1: 🖥️ Claude Desktop Setup

**What you'll learn**: GUI-based MCP server setup, config file location across platforms, shared memory configuration, and visual verification methods.

**🚀 RECOMMENDED: Individual MCP Servers**
- **Granular control**: Choose specific servers (memory, filesystem, sequential-thinking)
- **Custom configurations**: Shared memory across tools, custom file paths
- **Learning experience**: Understand how each MCP server works individually

**🔧 ALTERNATIVE: Simple Setup (mcp-cursor)**
- **One-command setup**: Install `mcp-cursor` for instant access to memory, filesystem, and reasoning
- **No complex configuration**: Works out of the box with minimal setup
- **Perfect for beginners**: Get started in under 5 minutes

**Key highlights**:
- Find config files via Claude Desktop UI across macOS, Windows, and Linux
- Clear distinction between individual servers (recommended) vs mcp-cursor (alternative)
- Step-by-step config file editing with validation
- Visual verification of active MCP servers in the UI

**[→ Read the complete Claude Desktop setup guide](./claude-desktop-setup.md)**

---

### 2.2: 💻 Claude Code (CLI) Setup

**What you'll learn**: Terminal-based MCP server setup, critical differences from Claude Desktop, and CLI verification commands.

**🚀 RECOMMENDED: Individual MCP Servers**
- **Manual configuration**: Install and configure each server individually
- **Critical requirement**: Must add `"type": "stdio"` to every server config (unlike Claude Desktop)
- **Learning experience**: Understand how each MCP server works and what it does

**🔧 ALTERNATIVE: Simple Setup (mcp-cursor)**
- **One-command setup**: Install `mcp-cursor` for instant access to memory, filesystem, and reasoning
- **Automatic stdio configuration**: mcp-cursor handles the required `"type": "stdio"` automatically
- **Perfect for CLI users**: Get started with a single npm install command

**Key highlights**:
- **Critical difference**: Claude Code requires `"type": "stdio"` in every server config
- Find and edit `~/.claude.json` config file
- Verify setup with `claude mcp list` and other CLI commands
- No restart needed - changes apply immediately

### 2.3: 🎯 Cursor IDE Setup

**What you'll learn**: IDE-integrated MCP server setup with both global and project-level configurations.

**🚀 RECOMMENDED: Individual MCP Servers**
- **Granular control**: Choose specific servers and configure custom file paths
- **Shared memory setup**: Configure cross-tool memory sharing with other applications
- **Learning experience**: Understand how each MCP server works in the IDE context

**🔧 ALTERNATIVE: Simple Setup (mcp-cursor)**
- **One-command setup**: Install `mcp-cursor` for instant access to memory, filesystem, and reasoning
- **IDE-optimized**: Designed specifically for Cursor's workflow
- **No complex paths**: Works seamlessly with Cursor's global and project configs

**Key highlights**:
- Choose between global config (all projects) or project config (version controlled)
- Find config files via Cursor UI and Command Palette
- Real-time JSON validation in Cursor editor
- Test MCP functionality directly in Cursor Chat

## Part 3: Testing Shared Memory Across All Tools

**After setting up Option 2 (Shared Memory):**

### Test Memory Across Tools

1. **Store info in one tool**: In Claude Desktop, ask "Remember my project is AcmeApp with React"
2. **Retrieve in other tools**: Ask "What's my project name?" in Claude Code and Cursor
3. **Verify all tools return**: "Your project is AcmeApp with React"

### Verification

**Check servers are active:**
- **Claude Desktop**: Look for MCP indicator in UI
- **Claude Code**: Run `claude mcp list`
- **Cursor**: Settings → MCP (should show green status)

**Troubleshooting:**
- Verify identical memory file paths across all tools
- Check for `YOUR_USERNAME` placeholders
- Restart applications after config changes

✅ **Success**: All tools remember the same information
