# Large Language Models Blog Posts

> LLMs, transformers, prompt engineering, and modern NLP techniques

## About This Category

This category focuses on Large Language Models (LLMs) including GPT, BERT, T5, LLaMA, and other transformer-based architectures. Learn about fine-tuning, prompt engineering, evaluation, optimization, and practical applications of LLMs.

## Topics Covered

- Transformer Architecture & Attention Mechanisms
- Pre-trained Language Models (BERT, GPT, T5, etc.)
- Fine-tuning Techniques (LoRA, QLoRA, Prefix Tuning)
- Prompt Engineering & In-Context Learning
- Chain-of-Thought Prompting
- Few-Shot & Zero-Shot Learning
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- LLM Evaluation & Benchmarks
- Model Compression & Quantization
- Hallucination Detection & Mitigation
- Context Length & Memory Management
- Multi-lingual LLMs
