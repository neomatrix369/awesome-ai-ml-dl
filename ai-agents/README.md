# AI Agents

This document outlines key concepts and components related to building AI agents.

## APIs

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are crucial for AI agents to interact with external services and data sources. Some popular APIs and libraries used in AI agent development include:

*   **Ollama:** Allows running large language models (LLMs) locally. This is beneficial for privacy, offline capabilities, and cost savings.
*   **LiteLLM:** Provides a unified interface to interact with various LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere, Anthropic). This simplifies switching between different models and providers.

## Context and Instructions

Providing clear and concise context and instructions is vital for an AI agent to perform tasks accurately and efficiently.

*   **Context:** This includes relevant background information, data, and previous interactions that the agent needs to understand the current task.
*   **Instructions:** These are specific commands or guidelines that tell the agent what to do, how to do it, and what constraints to follow. Well-defined instructions help in guiding the agent's behavior and ensuring desired outcomes.

## Tool Calls

Tool calls enable AI agents to extend their capabilities by interacting with external tools and functions.

*   **Function Calling:** LLMs can be instructed to call predefined functions or tools to perform specific actions, such as retrieving information from a database, calling an external API, or executing a piece of code.
*   **Output Parsing:** The agent needs to be able to parse the output from tool calls and integrate the results back into its workflow.

## MCP (Model-View-Controller-Presenter)

While not a direct acronym, the concepts from software architecture patterns like Model-View-Controller (MVC) and Model-View-Presenter (MVP) can be adapted for structuring AI agents.

*   **Model:** Represents the agent's knowledge, data, and the underlying LLM.
*   **View:** Handles the interaction with the user or other systems (e.g., displaying information, receiving input).
*   **Controller/Presenter:** Manages the flow of information and logic between the Model and the View. It interprets user input, invokes tools, updates the model, and determines what to present to the user. This helps in separating concerns and making the agent more modular and maintainable.

## Pydantic

Pydantic is a Python library for data validation and settings management using Python type hints. It is highly useful in AI agent development for:

*   **Data Validation:** Ensuring that data passed to and from LLMs, tools, and APIs conforms to expected schemas.
*   **Structured Output:** Defining clear and validated output structures for LLM responses, making it easier to parse and use the generated information reliably.
*   **Configuration Management:** Managing agent configurations and settings in a type-safe manner.

## MCP Integration with SSE and Stdio

Integrating MCP-based agents with various communication channels enhances their interactivity and usability.

*   **Server-Sent Events (SSE):** SSE is a web technology that allows a server to send real-time updates to a client over a single HTTP connection. For AI agents, this means the "View" can be a web interface that receives continuous updates from the agent (e.g., streaming responses, status updates) managed by the "Controller/Presenter". This is useful for long-running tasks or when providing incremental feedback to the user.
*   **Standard Input/Output (stdio):** For command-line interface (CLI) based agents, the "View" interacts with the user via stdio. The "Controller/Presenter" processes text input and sends text output back to the terminal. This is a straightforward way to interact with agents for local development, scripting, or integration with other CLI tools.

## Anonymous Agents and Feedback Loops

Developing robust AI agents often involves iterative improvement based on user interactions and feedback.

*   **Anonymous Agents:** These are agents that interact with users without revealing their underlying identity or specific model. This can be useful for collecting unbiased feedback or for A/B testing different agent versions.
*   **Feedback Loops:** Implementing mechanisms to capture explicit and implicit feedback from users is crucial.
    *   **Explicit Feedback:** Users directly providing ratings, corrections, or suggestions.
    *   **Implicit Feedback:** Analyzing user behavior, such as task completion rates, clarifications requested, or abandonment of interactions.
    This feedback is then used to refine the agent's "Model" (e.g., fine-tuning the LLM, updating knowledge bases) or its "Controller/Presenter" logic (e.g., improving instruction interpretation, tool selection).

## Agentic AI

Agentic AI refers to systems that can operate autonomously to achieve goals, make decisions, and take actions in an environment. Key characteristics include:

*   **Goal-oriented:** Agents are designed with specific objectives to achieve.
*   **Autonomous:** They can operate without constant human intervention.
*   **Perception:** They can perceive their environment through sensors or data inputs.
*   **Action:** They can take actions that affect their environment or internal state.
*   **Learning/Adaptation:** Many agentic systems can learn from experience and adapt their behavior over time. This often involves complex reasoning, planning, and memory capabilities.

## Tools and Frameworks for Building AI Agents

Several tools and frameworks have emerged to simplify the development of AI agents:

*   **Langchain:** An open-source framework for building applications with LLMs. It provides modules for managing prompts, memory, chains (sequences of calls), indexes, and agents.
*   **CrewAI:** A framework for orchestrating role-playing, autonomous AI agents. It helps in creating collaborative AI crews that can work together on complex tasks.
*   **Langsmith:** A platform by Langchain for debugging, testing, evaluating, and monitoring LLM applications. It provides visibility into agent behavior and helps in identifying areas for improvement.
*   **Google A2A (Agents for Automation):** While specific public details might vary, Google has research and products focused on AI agents for automating tasks and processes.
*   **Google GenAI (Generative AI):** Google offers a suite of Generative AI tools and models (e.g., Gemini) that can be the core "Model" component of AI agents, providing powerful language understanding and generation capabilities. This includes Vertex AI for building and deploying AI models.
*   **Other tools:** Many other specialized tools exist for aspects like vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate) for semantic search, workflow orchestration (e.g., Apache Airflow with AI plugins), and more.
